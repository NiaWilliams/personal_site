            <p>This page is about me <b>trying</b> to give advice about art.</p>
            
            <ol>Traditional art
                <li>Is usually done on either paper or canvas.</li>
                <li>Aiming for perfection with this will get you nowhere.</li>
                <li>Start out with pencil only.</li>
                <li>Light sketches are best for starting out, because they're easy to erase.</li>
                <li>Pen is for more permenant drawing and inking. Also depends on what brand you use that is easy for you to work with.</li>
                <li>Coloring is a lot harder than it sounds. Certain colors go well with each other, some don't. No questions asked. Maybe a few, but that's about it.</li>
                <li>Backgrounds are dificult unless you know what your doing and drawing.</li>
                <li>Drawing people is hard. You have to have the anatomy just right in order for it to pass. If it's something you made up, your stuff, your rules.</li>
                <li>Clothes are hard to draw too. It moves, wrinkles, and blows. It's annoying to keep track of sometimes, but you have to do it.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <ul>Digital Art
                <li>Usually done on computers, phones, art tablets, or tablets.</li>
                <li>Digital art is less restricted, but much more appealing.</li>
                <li>As I've said for tradional art, aiming for perfection will get you nowhere. There will always be someone better, and someone worse.</li>
                <li>Some prefer to use art tablets for things like sketches. It's easier if your good at traditional art because they come with pens.</li>
                <li>Inking is not relevant when using digital means for art. There are things called "layers", which are pretty self-explanitory.</li>
                <li>You can make a whole other layer for coloring, but once again, some colors go well with others, but it's easier to pick colors. But not easy to pick it twice unless you have it saved.</li>
                <li>You get the idea with the layer thing, so I'm going to move on. Backgrounds are a bit easier to do here because you can copy paste, or you can use tools to get straight lines or wavy lines.</li>
                <li>Drawing people is easier here as well. Photoshop is the best for drawing them though because you can adjust and re-adjust selected parts.</li>
                <li>Clothes are still hard to make unless you draw in a cartoony way.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>By: Nia Williams</h2>

        <p>This is a page about fun facts that relate the books on the first page. The rest is all my opinion.</p>

        <ol>Percy Jackson(first three) and Ender's Game(last three)
            <li>The full name of the author is Richard Russell Riordan Jr.</li>
            <li>It was first published on May 6, 2008.</li>
            <li>The original title of the book was going to be Percy 4.</li>
            <li>The author's name is Orson Scott Card.</li>
            <li>There is a series of books that follow this, coming up to a total of about 6.</li>
            <li>This is also has a comic series.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>Webtoons
            <li>Waffles and Pancakes is basically about two college students who do stupid stuff.</li>
            <li>So far Immortal Weakling is an annoyingly persistent MC and an extra trying to be heros.</li>
            <li>Webventures is the weirdest comedy comic ever made.</li>
            <li>Daily Life of Webtoon Creators is about two college adults trying to give advice about being webtoon authors.</li>
            <li>Winter Moon is pretty much a explosive pyromaniac and massive amounts of sarcasm.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>Video games
            <li>Battles in Pokemon Sun/Moon are different, but Cosmog looks the same even though he evolves into different things.</li>
            <li>Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest/Birthright are both difficult games, but in different ways. In conquest, everyone that anyone remotely likes dies. In birthright, all of your favorite characters die.</li>
            <li>Pokemon Y is an okay game in terms of difficulty. There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense though.</li>
            <li>Portal 2 is a suspenseful game that you would need someone in the room with you. But that's only because there's not a lot of sound.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>Computer games
            <li>While playing beginner chess, everyone else is an expert playing on beginner.</li>
            <li>Sudoku: Suprisingly, a lot of people find this game boring. It's not. It's difficult.</li>
            <li>2048 is one of those games where you'll quit for a while, then come back to it because you still haven't found out how to beat it.</li>
            <li>Run: Everyone loves this game. I hate this game, but I still play it because I can't beat that one level.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>Food
            <li>Christmas Brownies: This is literaly only made on Christmas, even though it's possible to make these on any other day.</li>
            <li>Pizza is good. Exept for supreme, canadian, and anything having to do with chicken. Or ketchup.</li>
            <li>Apple pie: It's actually pretty good. I don't normally eat pie though, they all look disgusting.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>Hobbies
            <li>Reading is what I do for at least 60% of the day.</li>
            <li>I don't write often, but when I do, it's trash.</li>
            <li>I draw only when I have an idea of what to draw, I don't draw all day every day.</li>
            <li>Playing video games can lead to losing track of time, and before you know it, it's 2 in the morning and you have a test that day.</li>
            <li>I watch a lot of movies and I don't have a specific genre I like.</li>
            <li>During the school year, I get at least 3 hours of sleep a day. During the summer it is possible for me to get less.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>YouTubers
            <li>Overly Sarcastic Productions: We all wished she was our history teacher.</li>
            <li>Jordan Persegati: He's actually a pretty good traditional artist. Most of his art almost looks digital.</li>
        </ol>
